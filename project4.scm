; Implementation of ask:
; get-method from object and apply the same object
; Implementation of delegation:
; get-method from general form (also the smallest one) and apply the specific form (also the bigger one).
; What i mean with general or smallest?
; I use general form to show that it is a first superclass, and specific form to show that it is
; a class that inherit from some superclass and specified with its own methods.
; In other words, number of general form is the smallest because it is more common behaviour.
; But when you specialize somethings, we may want to inherit from other classes or may want to have a special behaviours
; which only it has, then it is bigger than the general form.
; ask vs delegate
; Assume there is 3 classes. First ones radius is r (first general form), second ones radius is 2r (inner form), and
; The last one with radius 3r (specified one). Assume that they have same center. When we use the specified one,
; if we (for example change-location) use (ask 'r 'change-location), it affects only the r one. So r one's location changed, hence
; it acts like different object. Bu if we take out the method hem apply it to specified one, location changes with all of them and
; the center will contunie be same. Therefore, using delegate is more proper to inherited object.

; Violent person is an autonomous person which means it is inherited from autonomoud person.
; It has 2 new method and a modified method. Install method makes callback for atack method
; additining to autonomous install method and delegate other things from autonomous.
; It has type question and attack method. Attack method first find the people in the room,
; and choose one of them randomly. It chooses the weapon randomly from its weapons.
; There is a frequency for attacking. A number is choosed randomly from the interval [0,freq)
; If it is 0, then the violent person attacks. That means there is a 1/freq chance to attacking.
; It inherits other methods from autonomous part.
; I added a default weapon because finding a gun, person and the frequancy at the same time
; is really little chance, then i couldn't show the what happen when i attack.
